      # Disable incremental compilation.
      #
      # Incremental compilation is useful as part of an edit-build-test-edit cycle,
      # as it lets the compiler avoid recompiling code that hasn't changed. However,
      # on CI, we're not making small edits; we're almost always building the entire
      # project from scratch. Thus, incremental compilation on CI actually
      # introduces *additional* overhead to support making future builds
      # faster...but no future builds will ever occur in any given CI environment.
      #
      # See https://matklad.github.io/2021/09/04/fast-rust-builds.html#ci-workflow
      # for details.
